cd valentino-magic-beans

# Install dependencies
npm install

# (Optional) Set MailSlurp API key for email tests
export MAIL_SLURP_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run tests in a specific browser (Chromium)
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run specific test files
npx playwright test auth-flow.spec.ts
npx playwright test product-flow.spec.ts

# Run authentication flow with account creation
SIGN_UP_FLOW=true npx playwright test auth-flow.spec.ts

# Run tests with browser visible
npx playwright test --headed

# Debug mode (interactive)
npx playwright test --debug

# Generate HTML report
npx playwright test --reporter=html

# Open the HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

## üõ† Testing Practices Demonstrated

- **Locators & Actions:** Form filling, clicks, selections, keyboard/mouse events  
- **API Interception & Mocking:** Validate server interactions and test scenarios  
- **Email Verification:** Automated email flow testing with MailSlurp  
- **Page Object Model:** Modular, reusable, and maintainable test structure  
- **Advanced Features:** Parallel execution, fixtures/hooks, parameterized tests
